Hi! My name is [Constantine Lambridis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/constantine-a-lambridis-25033020b/)- I am a journalism and communication, and history double major at Lehigh University. I am a sophomore from Long Island, New York, who plans to attend law school upon my graduation from Lehigh. I chose to major in journalism and history because my passion for writing and learning. I have loved English and Social Studies for as long as I can remember, so continuing to learn about both subjects and broading my horizons through the two things I feel the most passionate about was imperitive to me at Lehigh. 

I am currently an associate editor of the sports section of Lehigh University's student-run newspaper, The Brown and White. I craft story pitches, conduct interviews with sources inside Lehigh Athletics, and edit articles for AP style and grammar mistakes, structural issues, and improper tone. I love working for The Brown and White because it allows me to combine two things I am deeply passionate about: sports and writing. I believe that sports bring people together, and that we can tell immersive stories that highlight some truly remarkable people, as well as the human condition. The biggest stories to me were never only about impressive statistics, they were about the faces behind the statistics, the athletes who sacrifced so much to play Division I sports and have aspirations and personalities that often go unnoticed when they are on the field. 

However, my latest project is not about a specific person, but a group of people, a community. I plan on documenting the drastic dip in Lehigh football attendance from the Mountain Hawks historic Division II championship win in 1977 to the present day. Up until the early 2010s, Lehigh football was pulling in roughly 10,000 fans per home game. They displayed a remarkable culture of school spirit that has since dissapated as the 2000s coalesced into the 2010s. There could be multiple reasons for the dip in attendance. Some have speculated that the Mountain Hawks move from conveniently located Taylor Stadium, which sat where the Rauch Business School and Zoellner Arts Center currently stand, to Goodman Stadium which is located on Goodman cmapus further up South Mountain, is responsible for the drop in attendance. Some believe the team's recent stretch of underwhelming losing seasons had something to do with it. Maybe Lehigh students have just lost that school spirit which the older generations still pride themselves on? But why? All of these reasons could be true, but as I continue the undertaking of verifying Lehigh football attendance figures prior to the reliable record keeping of the 21st century, it will take some investigative work to find the real reason for the decline.

## ***What I've been working on***


I have been recently fascinated by the drops in college football attendance. Across the nation, more and more schools have been seeing attendance decreases, and Lehigh is no different. Lehigh home and away football games have seen a drop in average attendance as diaplyed by this [chart](https://github.com/ConstantineLambridis/ConstantineLambridisSite/files/12778137/Lehigh.Football.Attendance.Infographic.pdf). The chart notes the average attendance per year of Lehigh football home and away games. Aside from the increase in average away game attendance last year, caused by Holy Cross and Lafayette's games against the Mountain Hawks pulling in an average of 11,562, both trends have taken a dive. I wanted to know how much Lehigh's attendance was falling and if it was indicative of a larger trend across the country. Since 2012, Lehigh's attendance has seen a 46% decrease, echoing the trend seen nationwide at their other away contests, both Patriot League and nonleague. Though performance is a factor, as the Mountain Hawks have seen a massive dip in attendance over the past 5 seasons with a win-percantage of just a shade over 30%, the decrease in attendance is alarming for a school with a proud football tradition. Aside from the Mountain Hawks recent struggles on the field, their opponents, who should theoretically be pulling in higher attendance numbers as they build up their football programs, have seen their growth stunted. With the exception of Holy Cross' anomoly figure, teams opposite the Mountain Hawks have displayed similar difficulties in finding attendees for their games.

Here is a timeline of the declining attendance at Lehigh football home games.

The graph above shows the preferred party locations of students filtered by if they are in Greek Life, a varsity athlete, or are unaffiliated with any Greek organization or varsity team. The graph shows that more of the surveyed Greek Life members prefer parties at their chapter houses located on campus on "The Hill" or Sayre Campus. This could be for multiple reasons: the fact that most parties on The Hill are held on Friday or Saturday nights, or that most fraternity members live in their respective on-campus houses. More athletes prefer off-campus housing which is likely due to the fact that if the teams were to throw parties for themselves and other varsity athletes, it would be in the off-campus houses that upperclassmen on the team's lease, giving it a more familiar feel. Additional reporting will be needed for why nonaffiliated students prefer off-campus parties to on-campus parties.

This bar chart displays the different ways that students get to on-campus fraternity parties, excluding people that live in the house. The large majority of students choose to walk, but it is worth doing a similar survey today, as Lehigh has moved away from the TRACS on-campus bus system in favor of the Packer, Mountaintop and Goodman Expresses. Doing a survey now would help us see if the present bus system is more effective at moving students up The Hill and if most students take the bus system now that it is more relaible than the TRACS system seemed to have been. The rides from other students category is likely high due to the prevelance of fraternity members offering off-campus or even on-campus students transportation before their parties.

Above are two maps that display data from Data.gov's [2013 Higher Education Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16WNZwO8Wpli-57mz06GQxDbqy8Ij9DZeIJ1bO6XNjP4/edit#gid=1288802348)- The data set notes the location of each university, the highest degree offered, if it is an HBCU, the religious affiliation, number of applicants, SAT and ACT scores in the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of students, enrollment, tuition, control of institution, degree of urbanization, and students by race and sex. The study was based on the institutions self-reported data and the motivation for this is to better understand how these schools operate and expose discrepencies. The implications of this is that we can potentially remedy inequities in the education system based on location, class, race, and type of institution, religuious or nonaffiliated, public or private, and an HBCU or otherwise. 



This leads to the importance of the maps above. The first displays the locations of HBCUs and whether they are in cities, towns, or rural areas. This highlights not only the low number of HBCUs compared to other universities, but also the low number of HBCUs in suburban areas which is likely due to the red-lining practices of the 20th century used to keep suburban neighborhoods white, leading to only one suburban HBCU. There are also six HBCUs located 10-35 miles from the nearest big town, which is not ideal when attempting to access stores and the resources of a bigger, more populated area. There are no HBCUs within 10 miles of a big town. 



The next map shows the degrees offered by HBCUs compared to other universities. We notice only seven HBCUs offer a master's degree while 15 have a bachelor's degree as their highest degree. Only three offer a Doctor's degrees categorized as research/scholarship and professional practice. For students looking to attend an HBCU, their options to obtain advanced degrees are rather thin, and therby present Black students with less academic opportunities, and in a world where advanced degrees are valued much more than a bachelor's degree on the employer's end, it makes it even more difficult for these individuals to find a job. 

Altogether, HBCUs are disadvantaged when it comes to having a plethora of locations and advanced degrees. The US needs to do a better job affording these universities a better chance to thrive and expand because it directly impacts the ability for these African American students to get a better education, college experience, and job afterward.
