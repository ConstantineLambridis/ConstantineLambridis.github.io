# Constantine Lambridis' Site

Hi! My name is [Constantine Lambridis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/constantine-a-lambridis-25033020b/)- I am a journalism and communication, and history double major at Lehigh University. I am a sophomore from Long Island, New York, who plans to attend law school upon my graduation from Lehigh. I chose to major in journalism and history because my passion for writing and learning. I have loved English and Social Studies for as long as I can remember, so continuing to learn about both subjects and broading my horizons through the two things I feel the most passionate about was imperitive to me at Lehigh. 

I am currently an associate editor of the sports section of Lehigh University's student-run newspaper, The Brown and White. I craft story pitches, conduct interviews with sources inside Lehigh Athletics, and edit articles for AP style and grammar mistakes, structural issues, and improper tone. I love working for The Brown and White because it allows me to combine two things I am deeply passionate about: sports and writing. I believe that sports bring people together, and that we can tell immersive stories that highlight some truly remarkable people, as well as the human condition. The biggest stories to me were never only about impressive statistics, they were about the faces behind the statistics, the athletes who sacrifced so much to play Division I sports and have aspirations and personalities that often go unnoticed when they are on the field. 

However, my latest project is not about a specific person, but a group of people, a community. I plan on documenting the drastic dip in Lehigh football attendance from the Mountain Hawks historic Division II championship win in 1977 to the present day. Up until the early 2010s, Lehigh football was pulling in roughly 10,000 fans per home game. They displayed a remarkable culture of school spirit that has since dissapated as the 2000s coalesced into the 2010s. There could be multiple reasons for the dip in attendance. Some have speculated that the Mountain Hawks move from conveniently located Taylor Stadium, which sat where the Rauch Business School and Zoellner Arts Center currently stand, to Goodman Stadium which is located on Goodman cmapus further up South Mountain, is responsible for the drop in attendance. Some believe the team's recent stretch of underwhelming losing seasons had something to do with it. Maybe Lehigh students have just lost that school spirit which the older generations still pride themselves on? But why? All of these reasons could be true, but as I continue the undertaking of verifying Lehigh football attendance figures prior to the reliable record keeping of the 21st century, it will take some investigative work to find the real reason for the decline.
