# Constantine Lambridis' Site

Hi! My name is [Constantine Lambridis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/constantine-a-lambridis-25033020b/)- I am a journalism and communication, and history double major at Lehigh University. I am a sophomore from Long Island, New York, who plans to attend law school upon my graduation from Lehigh. I chose to major in journalism and history because my passion for writing and learning. I have loved English and Social Studies for as long as I can remember, so continuing to learn about both subjects and broading my horizons through the two things I feel the most passionate about was imperitive to me at Lehigh. 

I am currently an associate editor of the sports section of Lehigh University's student-run newspaper, The Brown and White.
